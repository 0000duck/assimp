D bindings for the Assimp library (http://assimp.sf.net).
---

These bindings provide access to Assimp's C API. They were directly created
from the C header files.

You should be able to create sufficient DDoc documentation for the bindings
using your favourite build tool (such as Rebuild). Please refer to the main
(Doxygen-generated) documentation for general topics.

Please contact <klickverbot@gmail.com> for any bindings-specific issues.
