To build the doxygen documentation on your own, follow these steps:

a) download & install latest doxygen

c) navigate to ./doc
d) and run 'doxygen'

For the inpatient:

Windows: go to ./workspaces/vc8 or ./workspaces/vc9, open the
VS Solution and build for your preferred build target ...
release-dll is usually the best choice. Adjust the runtime library to
your needs, multithreaded-dll is preconfigured by default.

Unix: try running 'make' in the ./code dir. Or SCons from
./workspaces/SCons. Or CMAKE, from the CMakelists.txt. Choose whatever
buildtool you like most.
