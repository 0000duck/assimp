<h1>ASSIMP - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<h4>Can I use the library for a commercial product?</h4>
Yes. ASSIMP is licensed under a modified BSD license. Its contents in just one sentence: you may use the library for free, in commercial or non-commercial applications, but you must include our license with your product and you may not advertise with us.

<h4>Is ASSIMP able to export assets?</h4>
No. ASSIMP is an <b>import</b> library. It is intended to be used to import assets exported from programs like 3ds max into game engines. Normally you won't need to export the assets again.


<h4>For which languages is the API provided?</h4>
The ASSIMP API is provided both as a plain-C interface and as an object-oriented C++ interface, which is the main API. All ports (jAssimp, Assimp.net, ...) and even the C-style API are just wrappers around this interface. Therefore, if your project allows the use of C++, you should use the C++-API.


<h4>Is the library thread-safe?</h4>
Yes. ASSIMP is completely thread-safe, as long as you create an extra 'Importer' instance for each thread. The C-API and all ports are doing this automatically for you.

<h4>Who are you (the guys behind ASSIMP)?</h4>
Most of use are professional software developers from Germany, but not in GameDev business. Graphics/game programming is a hobby for all of us.

<h4>Can I write a new loader for the library?</h4>
Sure, as long as you're able to write stable code and the format is not too exotic ... We'd highly appreciate any help. When you're finished, contact us and we're going to test it. If it works well, it will be included with the next release of the library.

<h4>I love you. May I marry all of you?</h4>
We're sorry, but this is absolutely not possible.
